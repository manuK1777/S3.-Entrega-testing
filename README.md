# Sprint 3 IT Academy | Video management tool

## Introduction

A company in the audiovisual sector has asked us for a web application that will allow their employees to quickly find movies from a large database they have, since the process is currently done manually.

You will be in charge of setting up the core of the application: all the logic of filtering and sorting of movies. You have 2 weeks to finish, which is how long this sprint lasts.
